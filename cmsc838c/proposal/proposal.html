		<h2>Neural Light Field Rendering in Augmented Reality</h2>
	   </p>
	   <p><h3><a href="https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/aslan_umd_edu/EVyb0BIkFlFLm7F4x9gFQLYBskoyVLU9Tho7NjGZIahfzQ?e=LDxl6f"" target="_blank"><i>Click here for the online Proposal Presentation</i></a></h3></p>
	   <p>Light fields are effective representations of 3D scenes and they have been widely used for displaying 3D visual content. Conventionally, scenes are represented with 4D light fields consisting of discrete sets of views where each view is defined by a discrete grid of pixels. This high-dimensional space causes memory, storage, and transmission requirements to growÂ rapidly with the resolution, therefore limiting the visual quality of the light fields. Alternatively, we can represent the light field with a continuous functional representation, where the domain of the signal is mapped to the quantities of interest by a function and the function is only coupled with the complexity of the signal and not with the resolution. Although the mapping function is not analytically tractable, we can approximate this mapping function by a neural network.</p>
	   <p>Moreover, most light field displays are not mobile and the user interaction is often neglected. One particular approach to introduce interactivity and provide mobile displays is to render the light fields in Augmented Reality (AR) where the users can directly interact with the light fields.</p>
	   <p>In this project, we aim to explore leveraging implicit neural representations to provide an efficient compressed representation of light fields and using these representations to render light fields in AR. For this purpose, we plan to capture photorealistic scenes with neural light field representations and display interactive light fields in AR by rendering the views in realtime.</p>
	   <p>We plan to build upon Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN) and explore how to train more efficient and effective representation networks.</p>
